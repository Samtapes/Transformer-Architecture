This is an algorithm very similar to the oficial paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

Transformers revolutionized deep learning models, many famous models came from transformers, such as GPT, BERT, etc.
Transformers have many applications, such as language translation, chatbot, code generation, etc.
